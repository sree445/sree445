##About My intro(AWS)

12 years of experience in software engineering. started my career as a
Java / SQL developer.
was working as a software engineer for 4 years, before then specialising
in data engineering, so he’s bringing all the strong programming, cloud, and
distributed computing systems, as a prerequisite before moving into data.

● He has been using cloud services for 4 years now, back to back. He has on-prem
and cloud experience. Also migrating on-prem solutions over to cloud-based
solutions too.
● Sree is overall a hands-on data specialist, strong in data modelling, not just a data
engineer to process things. He has strong SQL skills from his first job as a Java
Oracle PL/SQL Developer.
● When it comes to Data Engineering, and Big Data ecosystem he’s using Python and
Scala.
● He has some DataOps experience and best practices too, as well as experience with
DevOps tooling like Terraform.
● Strong at data warehousing solutions and data modelling.
● Overall, Sree is very experienced at architecting, building and testing sophisticated
data pipelines, ETL and distributed data processing and distributed computing
pipelines.
● He has some exposure to Data Science models. He’s working alongside data
scientists on a daily basis, so has a deep understanding on what’s happening on that
side.
●
Technical Compatibility
● Data Tools in General
○ AWS: EMR,Step functions,Event Bridge,Athena,Glue,S3,EC2,RDS,Redshift,Kinesis
and Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka

○ Non-AWS: hadoop, Spark (PySpark and Scala Spark),flume,Sqoop, Pubsub, Apache
Beam, Talend, Hive, Hbase, Cassandra, Mysql, Mongo DB,Teradata ,oracle,
postgresql, Databricks,DBT.

● Distributed data computing & data processing
● Batch Processing of large data sets
● ETL/ELT
○ 7 years experience in architecting and building ETL solutions, from scratch,
has a key knowledge interest in this space. experienced in non-cloud & cloud services to 
support the development.
● Building real-time data processing/streaming solutions
○ using the following tech to deliver real time data processing and real time data
streaming using the following technologies and methologies: Kafka, pub sub
streaming, streaming ingestion pipeline and Apache Beam.
● Building APIs
has developed scalable APIs in Scala and Python
● Tech Leadership / Mentoring Experience
○ Given that Sree has some leadership experience,happy and comfortable working as an IC (individual
contributor) but also has the experience to lead, mentor, or coordinate team
